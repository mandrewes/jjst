Javascript and CSS Runtime Aggregation Compilation Web Filters


Why would I want this?
======================

Compiling and then caching aggregated content at runtime means you can

- Using the most simple dependency method "includes" you can aggregate all your javascript and css together, which is easy for anyone to understand
- Have exactly the same process run during development as you have in TEST and PROD
- Don't need any special "file system watcher"
- Can inject information (such as variables and constants) at runtime in each environment
- Can dynamically enable or disable features using a pragma style profiles
